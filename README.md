# Obsidian template

These are my preferred defaults to start up a new Obsidian project.

See [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) for info about the folder structure. It's a great 5-minute read.

# Installing

To create the folder structure, run `mkdir.sh`.
It will create the following folders.
- projects
- areas
- resources
- archives
- projects/monthly
- projects/weekly
- projects/daily

Don't forget to update the plugins!
